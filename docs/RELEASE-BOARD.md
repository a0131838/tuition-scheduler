# RELEASE BOARD

## Current Production Snapshot

- Current service: `sgtmanage.com`
- Process: `pm2 -> tuition-scheduler`
- Last checked: `2026-03-30`
- Health check: `/admin/login` => `200`
- Version alignment: `ALIGNED`
- Exact server/local/origin commit hashes: use `bash ops/server/scripts/new_chat_startup_check.sh`

## Current Known State

- Local HEAD: current production branch head for `feat/strict-superadmin-availability-bypass`.
- Previous server fix remains in place: upload static paths under `/uploads/*` are reachable.
- `bash ops/server/scripts/new_chat_startup_check.sh` confirmed local/origin/server are aligned and `/admin/login` => `200`.
- `2026-03-26-r1`, `2026-03-26-r2`, and `2026-03-26-r3` are now live on the current server commit lineage.
- Release-doc gate requires `CHANGELOG-LIVE`, `RELEASE-BOARD`, and a matching `TASK-*` file in the same deploy commit.

## Open Risks

- Working tree hygiene risk: local repo currently contains unrelated untracked files and generated artifacts; avoid mixing them into deploy commits.
- Human memory risk: changes were spread across multiple sessions.
- Finance menu perception risk: role-based sidebar can look like "missing features" for FINANCE users.
- New process risk: deploy will fail if release docs are not included in the deploy commit.
- Historical risk confirmed: server env previously pointed to localhost DB in older backups.

## Process Guard (Installed)

1. `deploy_app.sh` now calls `verify_release_docs.sh` by default.
2. GitHub Actions deploy workflow now runs the same gate before SSH deploy.
3. Emergency bypass exists: `SKIP_RELEASE_DOC_CHECK=true` (use only for urgent hotfix).

## Server Handoff Guard (Installed)

1. Added fixed server profile doc: `docs/SERVER-HANDOFF.md`
2. Added local config template: `ops/server/server-handoff.env.example`
3. Added one-command scripts:
   - `bash ops/server/scripts/quick_check.sh`
   - `bash ops/server/scripts/quick_deploy.sh`

## Next Mandatory Step (No Business Logic Change)

1. Keep `CHANGELOG-LIVE`, `RELEASE-BOARD`, `TASK-*` updated for each deploy commit.
2. Add post-deploy quick check for a known `/uploads/payment-proofs/*` URL.
3. Keep ops docs aligned with Neon-as-production-db policy.

## 2026-03-26-r1 Deployed

- Deployed: group package alignment is live on the current production branch lineage.
- Scope: use one shared preferred-package rule for group enrollment preview, actual enrollment, attendance default ordering, and balance preview.
- Business impact: group classes prefer `GROUP_MINUTES`; legacy `GROUP_COUNT` remains fallback. 1-on-1 logic unchanged.
- Validation:
  - `npm run build`
  - `bash ops/server/scripts/new_chat_startup_check.sh`
  - group enrollment preview result matches enrollment submit result
  - legacy `GROUP_COUNT` preview is not blocked by minute-duration comparison

## 2026-03-26-r2 Deployed

- Deployed: waived-attendance todo fix is live on the current production branch lineage.
- Scope: todo deduction summary respects `waiveDeduction` and does not flag assessment lessons as pending deduction.
- Business impact: dashboard/todo card messaging only. Attendance save and package deduction behavior unchanged.
- Validation:
  - `npm run build`
  - waived attendance sessions show `No deduction required / 无需减扣` in todo center
  - `bash ops/server/scripts/new_chat_startup_check.sh`

## 2026-03-26-doc-status Deployed

- Deployed: release document alignment patch is live on the current production branch.
- Scope: close out startup-check mismatch findings and keep release docs consistent with the actual deployed branch state.
- Business impact: none. Documentation/process alignment only.

## 2026-03-26-r3 Deployed

- Deployed: backend integrity hardening is live on the current production branch lineage.
- Scope: backend integrity hardening for scheduling, top-up, expense claim transitions, and teacher availability cleanup.
- Business impact:
  - exact duplicate `Session` writes are now blocked by DB uniqueness plus controlled `409` handling
  - admin/teacher availability creation rejects overlapping ranges instead of silently stacking slots
  - historical availability data has already been normalized in the production database and post-clean audit is clean
- Validation:
  - `npm run test:backend`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm run audit:availability-integrity`
  - `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- Deploy note:
  - production DB cleanup + migrations were applied and the application branch has now been deployed
  - `bash ops/server/scripts/new_chat_startup_check.sh` confirms local/origin/server are aligned on the live branch head
  - release-doc closeout is tracked as a docs-only follow-up on the same production branch lineage

## 2026-03-27-r1 Deployed

- Scope: optimistic-lock retry guard for `partner/parent billing` blob stores and related approval writes.
- Business impact:
  - concurrent `AppSetting` JSON writes in billing/approval flows are retried against latest `updatedAt`
  - conflicting writes now fail explicitly instead of silently overwriting another operator's invoice / receipt / approval update
  - existing invoice / receipt / approval data structure and UI flow stay unchanged
- Validation:
  - `npm run test:backend`
  - `npm run build`
  - billing optimistic-lock regression tests pass

## 2026-03-29-r1 Deployed

- Scope: hotfix approval JSON hydration for parent receipt, partner receipt, and partner settlement approval stores after the optimistic-lock rollout.
- Business impact:
  - stored approval rows now load from `AppSetting` arrays correctly instead of falling back to empty state
  - manager/finance receipt approval status is preserved and visible again
  - no route, permission, or approval-order rules changed
- Validation:
  - `npm run test:backend`
  - `npm run build`
  - parent receipt approval regression test reads an existing stored approval row successfully

## 2026-03-29-r2 Deployed

- Scope: add a non-runtime guardrail for the `AppSetting` optimistic-lock helper contract.
- Business impact:
  - no business flow or route behavior change
  - future JSON-store callers are less likely to mis-handle already-parsed `sanitize` input
- Validation:
  - `npm run test:backend`
  - parsed-json contract test for `loadJsonAppSettingForDb` passes

## 2026-03-30-r1 Deployed

- Scope: expense-claim duplicate-submit guard and Ahmar duplicate-row cleanup.
- Business impact:
  - repeated taps on expense submission no longer create many identical `SUBMITTED` claims
  - teacher/admin expense forms disable the submit button after the first tap
  - Ahmar's duplicated `2026-03-29` transport claims were reduced to one retained claim plus duplicate file cleanup
  - historical missing file cases are not auto-rewritten; those still require recovery or re-upload
- Validation:
  - `npm run test:backend`
  - `npm run build`
  - duplicate expense-claim lookup regression test passes

## 2026-03-30-r2 Deployed

- Scope: controlled admin route for parent payment proof open/preview in receipt approvals.
- Business impact:
  - admin receipt approvals no longer depends on direct static `relativePath` links for parent payment proof files
  - payment proof open/preview now resolves from `paymentRecordId`, which avoids false "404 means no upload" conclusions when original filename and stored filename differ
  - upload, receipt creation, and approval logic remain unchanged
- Validation:
  - `npm run build`
  - admin receipt approvals uses `/api/admin/parent-payment-records/[id]/file` for parent payment proof open/preview

## 2026-03-30-r3 Deployed

- Scope: allow rejected expense claims to be corrected and resubmitted back to `SUBMITTED`.
- Business impact:
  - teachers can resubmit a rejected claim instead of creating a second claim manually
  - resubmit clears reject markers and sends the original claim back into the approval queue
  - approval, payment, and archive rules remain unchanged
- Validation:
  - `npm run test:backend`
  - `npm run build`
  - manual deploy check confirms `local/origin/server = fa1d341`
  - `https://sgtmanage.com/admin/login` returns `200`
- Release closeout: release-doc gate follow-up synced in the next docs commit on the same live branch lineage.

## 2026-03-30-r4 Deployed

- Scope: teacher expense-claim UX wording/visibility polish for status labels, attachment health, and rejected-claim next-step guidance.
- Business impact:
  - statuses now read as bilingual human language instead of raw status codes
  - missing attachments are explicitly labeled instead of only failing through open/download links
  - rejected claims show a clearer bilingual action card to guide correction and resubmission
  - no approval, payment, or archive rule changed
- Validation:
  - `npm run build`
