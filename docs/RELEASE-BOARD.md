# RELEASE BOARD

## Current Production Snapshot

- Current service: `sgtmanage.com`
- Process: `pm2 -> tuition-scheduler`
- Last checked: `2026-03-26`
- Health check: `/admin/login` => `200`

## Current Known State

- Local HEAD: group package alignment patch (shared selection rule for enrollment, attendance default ordering, and balance preview).
- Previous server fix remains in place: upload static paths under `/uploads/*` are reachable.
- `bash ops/server/scripts/new_chat_startup_check.sh` confirmed local/origin/server commit `6536928` are aligned.

## Open Risks

- Working tree hygiene risk: local repo currently contains unrelated untracked files and generated artifacts; avoid mixing them into deploy commits.
- Human memory risk: changes were spread across multiple sessions.
- Finance menu perception risk: role-based sidebar can look like "missing features" for FINANCE users.
- New process risk: deploy will fail if release docs are not included in the deploy commit.
- Historical risk confirmed: server env previously pointed to localhost DB in older backups.

## Process Guard (Installed)

1. `deploy_app.sh` now calls `verify_release_docs.sh` by default.
2. GitHub Actions deploy workflow now runs the same gate before SSH deploy.
3. Emergency bypass exists: `SKIP_RELEASE_DOC_CHECK=true` (use only for urgent hotfix).

## Server Handoff Guard (Installed)

1. Added fixed server profile doc: `docs/SERVER-HANDOFF.md`
2. Added local config template: `ops/server/server-handoff.env.example`
3. Added one-command scripts:
   - `bash ops/server/scripts/quick_check.sh`
   - `bash ops/server/scripts/quick_deploy.sh`

## Next Mandatory Step (No Business Logic Change)

1. Keep `CHANGELOG-LIVE`, `RELEASE-BOARD`, `TASK-*` updated for each deploy commit.
2. Add post-deploy quick check for a known `/uploads/payment-proofs/*` URL.
3. Keep ops docs aligned with Neon-as-production-db policy.

## 2026-03-26-r1 Ready For Deploy

- Target: deploy current branch commit with group package alignment.
- Scope: use one shared preferred-package rule for group enrollment preview, actual enrollment, attendance default ordering, and balance preview.
- Business impact: group classes prefer `GROUP_MINUTES`; legacy `GROUP_COUNT` remains fallback. 1-on-1 logic unchanged.
- Validation:
  - `npm run build`
  - `bash ops/server/scripts/new_chat_startup_check.sh`
  - group enrollment preview result matches enrollment submit result
  - legacy `GROUP_COUNT` preview is not blocked by minute-duration comparison
